# U-District Fire Responses
## Working Title: Demonstrating Organized Information of Fire Calls of U-District  
### Brandon Miller, Jiaxin Wang, Wayne Wang

#### Introduction:

* This project is aiming to analyze and reorganize the 911 fire call responses around U-District, Seattle. We want to identify the fire call occurrence trends based on time of the year, time of the day as well as the locations.
* This project would help fire department to response to fire calls more efficiently, help government officials to notice the potential safety hazards, etc.

#### Research Questions:
* _What parts of the U-district are at higher risk of incidents necessitating a fire call? What about at different times of the year?_
* _What types of fire call incidents are most common, and how is this changing?_
